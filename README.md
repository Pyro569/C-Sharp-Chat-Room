# C-Sharp-Chat-Room
### About  
In an attempt to get better at networking, I am creating a simple chatroom program. When I saw simple, I mean simple, its no discord 2.0, and never will be.  
At the moment it is technically TWO separate programs, one is a server, the other is a client.   
  
### How to use  
At the moment you will need to compile the code yourself for both programs, but seeing as they are small, get over it, I don't really care. One program is the client app and the other is the server app. One person will need to run the server app FIRST, then the other open the client app. The client app will prompt for a username, and then allow you to start sending messages. The server program will receive the messages from the client, however cannot send messages back, however a solution to this will hopefully be implemented.
  
### Current Issues  
1. Only one client program can connect to server client
2. Server client cannot send messages back
3. Only works on local network (and potentially local machine)  

### Plans  
1. Allow two users to connect that are not on the same network  
2. Allow more than two users to connect  
3. Stability  
4. Allow server host to send messages back (Might not need if more than one client program can connect but whatever)
