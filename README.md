# C-Sharp-Chat-Room
In an attempt to get better at networking, I am creating a simple chatroom program. When I saw simple, I mean simple, its no discord 2.0, and never will be.  
At the moment it is technically TWO separate programs, one is a server, the other is a client. One person runs the server and currently, ONLY ONE person on the same network can connect and send messages. Currently the server client receives it, but cannot send back. Attempting to connect two will only connect the first one that joins. I am hoping to make it better and work better with a few plans such as  
  
1. Allow two users to connect that are not on the same network  
2. Allow more than two users to connect  
3. Stability  
4. Allow server host to send messages back (Might not need if more than one client program can connect but whatever)
